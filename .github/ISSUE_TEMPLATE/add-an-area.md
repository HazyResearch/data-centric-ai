Use this template to propose a new area page. A good rule-of-thumb to decide whether a topic merits an area page is whether it would pass muster at a workshop in a machine learning venue.

Please address the following questions when raising this issue:
- what story you might tell about the topic's importance to data-centric AI
- whether this topic is related to other areas in data-centric AI, and why existing discussions may not be sufficient 
- what subtopics, resources and related work you may discuss in the area page

If your request to add the new area is approved, you can submit a PR with the following changes:
- add an additional area in README.md
- add an area page with relevant discussion
